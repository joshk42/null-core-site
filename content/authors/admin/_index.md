Hi! I'm nade_defeat or 'nade' for short and I have built null.core from the ground up and the one responsible for most of the servers you see online. In my professional life, I work as a Systems/Infrastructure Engineer for a local University. Gaming with my buddies at LAN parties in High School is what gave me my start and it will always have a special place in my heart.
